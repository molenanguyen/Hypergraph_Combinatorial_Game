# Combinatorial_Game_Theory

I created two new impartial games (one new game just today) on different #DiscreteStructures, especially on #Hypergraphs, and wrote Mathematical Theorems and Proofs analyzing the winning strategy that always works perfectly for all positions in my two new games. From the working winning strategy, it is not hard to create the games and let the players play versus the Machine.

The rule of the game is that player A and player B will play alternatively. In a turn, one player can only remove one vertex, or one face (hyperedge). Whoever removes the last vertex wins. 

"The goal of studying combinatorial games is to determine a winning strategy for them. A winning strategy for player A (respectively, B) in a combinatorial game is a strategy that specifies a move from each position that guarantees a win for player A (respectively B)."

There are 2 types of Combinatorial Games, which are impartial games and partisan games. I am more focused on the impartial games. An example of impartial games is #TheGameOfNim. In The Game Of Nim, to analyze a winning strategy, Mathematicians used the Theorem called "the Sprague–Grundy Theorem." If the Nim-value of a position (sometimes it is called Nimber, or Grundy number) is found, it is always a way to win the game from all positions. The reason is that there are two famous theorems about impartial games. The first one is that "Every impartial game is equivalent to a nim-heap." The second one is that "In a normal Nim game, the player making the first move has a winning strategy if and only if the nim-sum of the sizes of the heaps is not zero. Otherwise, the second player has a winning strategy."

I am so excited that I have successfully created two new Combinatorial Games (impartial games) on new #DiscreteStructures.

I am also happy that I have finished my Original Mathematics Journal on #GraphTheory and #CombinatorialGameTheory with my 3 Original Lemmas and 4 Original Theorems (with full Mathematical proofs) on analyzing the Winning Strategy for my games.

My next goal is to implement the game on Github so everyone can try playing against the Machine.
I am also looking forward to having some collaborations on #Kaggle projects and any other open source platform to enrich my knowledge on #DataScience and #MachineLearning.

"A combinatorial game is a two player game that satisfies the following conditions: The game is deterministic: there is no randomization mechanism such as flipping a coin or rolling a die. There is perfect information in the game: each player knows all the information about the state of the game, and nothing is hidden."

This is more information about Combinatorial Games: "The goal of studying Combinatorial Games is to determine a winning strategy for them."
There are two main types of Combinatorial Games, which are impartial games and partisan games. Impartial games are the games where players A and players B have all of the "same" possible moves. It means that player B can make whichever moves that player A can make. ( I will explain this "same" more when I compare impartial games with partisan games). Some familar examples of impartial games are The Game of Nim, Chomp, Dots and Boxes, and Kayles (or The Game of Kayles), In impartial games, the winning strategy for each player can be analyzed (can be solved) by applying the Sprague–Grundy theorem.

On the other hand, partisan games are the ones that not all moves are available to both player A and player B. Examples of partisan games are Chess and Go. In Chess, player A and player B do not have the "same" possible moves, because we have two sets of pieces (two colors of pieces) that are black and white. If you are player A and you play the black pieces, you cannot move the white pieces of your opponent. With the same argument (the argument of two sets of pieces), Go is also a partisan game.

If you are still interested in Combinatorial Game Theory and you just want to start with an introduction book, I suggest you reading "Lessons in Play: An Introduction to Combinatorial Game Theory" by Michael H. Albert, Richard J. Nowakowski, David Wolfe.

If you want to know more indepth information about Combinatorial Game Theory, you can read "Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays" (currently 4 volumes) of  Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway, and Richard K. Guy.
