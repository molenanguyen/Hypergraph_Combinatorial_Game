# Game_Theory

In a period of 4 weeks, I finished my short Mathematics Journal in the topics of Graph Theory and Combinatorial Game Theory with my 3 Original Lemmas and 4 Original Theorems 
(with full Mathematical proofs provided.)
I am so excited that I have successfully created a new Combinatorial Game on all kinds of right pyramids.

"The goal of studying Combinatorial Games is to determine a winning strategy for them."

"A combinatorial game is a two player game that satisfies the following conditions: The game is deterministic: there is no randomization mechanism such as flipping a coin or rolling a die. There is perfect information in the game: each player knows all the information about the state of the game, and nothing is hidden."
